//! # Burrmill
//!
//! SQL over sealed Parquet segments plus a live tip, with exact integer arithmetic and
//! refuse-on-overflow, in one binary with nothing to configure.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! A **query engine-layer**. It owns the semantics *and* the execution of a deliberately small
//! admitted subset of SQL - the shapes a blockchain indexer actually runs - and it owns them all the
//! way down to the vectorised operator. It is not a general database and does not want to be. It
//! needs to be faster than DuckDB on *these* shapes over *this* layout, and merely honest about
//! everything else.
//!
//! ## What it rents, permanently
//!
//! Arrow for the in-memory format and its kernels, and parquet-rs for decode. Nobody solo-maintains
//! a better SIMD kernel library, and the evidence that trying would pay does not exist. Everything
//! above them is ours.
//!
//! ## The three claims, and how to check them
//!
//! - **Faster.** The ancestor of [`exec::SignedFoldExec`] measured 0.55-0.85x DuckDB across 24 of 24
//!   configurations where general DataFusion measured 2.53-2.80x *slower* on the same query. The
//!   `burrmill-bench` crate reproduces that head to head, parity first, timings second.
//! - **Exact.** Integer overflow returns [`BurrmillError::Overflow`], never a wrapped number.
//!   DataFusion wraps silently and has no core flag to stop it; DuckDB errors on `HUGEINT` but is
//!   not watertight everywhere.
//! - **Closed.** Table names resolve against a positive allowlist and there are no file-reading SQL
//!   functions to register. `read_parquet('/etc/passwd')` does not fail a check - it has nowhere to
//!   parse to.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use burrmill::{Burrmill, Limits};
//!
//! let db = Burrmill::open_segments("t", std::path::Path::new("./segments"))?;
//! let answer = db.query(
//!     r#"SELECT addr, SUM(d) AS net FROM (
//!            SELECT "to" AS addr, TRY_CAST("value" AS HUGEINT) AS d FROM t

//!        ) GROUP BY addr HAVING SUM(d) <> 0 ORDER BY addr"#,
//!     Limits::default(),
