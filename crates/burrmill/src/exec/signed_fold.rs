//! `SignedFoldExec` - the owned operator, and the reason the project exists.
//!
//! Its ancestor is nuthatch's #987 spike, which measured **0.55-0.85x DuckDB across 24 of 24
//! configurations** on `net_balances` while general DataFusion on the same shape measured
//! 2.53-2.80x *slower* (#964). That is a three-to-fivefold swing between renting general execution
//! and owning a specialised one, and it is the entire architectural argument.
//!
//! What makes it fast is not clever: it is the same three things DuckDB does, applied to one shape.
//! Morsel-driven parallelism over row groups rather than files; thread-local hash tables merged
//! once at the end rather than one shared table under contention; and a fast non-cryptographic
//! hash, because std's SipHash is DoS resistance we are not paying for here.
