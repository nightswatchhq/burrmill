//! #40: every operator that holds its input, run under a budget over string views, is charged within
//! a stated factor of the same statement over `Utf8`.
//!
//! A view column is charged for every buffer it references, and a 128-row batch of views can
//! reference a 1 MiB buffer it fills a few kilobytes of. Each test runs one statement twice on one
//! budgeted engine, once over the table's own `Utf8View` columns and once over the same columns cast
//! to `Utf8`, and compares the pool's peak reservation. The plan is checked for the operator, so a
//! planner change that stops exercising it fails here rather than passing vacuously.
